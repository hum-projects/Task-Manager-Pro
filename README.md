Copy
Edit
/backend
  â”œâ”€â”€ db.py               # DB connection and setup
  â”œâ”€â”€ models.py           # User, Project, Task classes
  â”œâ”€â”€ auth.py             # Login, registration, role-based access
  â”œâ”€â”€ manager.py          # Core logic for task/project operations


  
2. Frontend Module (GUI Interface)
